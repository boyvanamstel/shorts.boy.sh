Tried [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) to create a flow that allows me to easily add a new post here.

Configured everything and it looked pretty cool. Then I discovered the admin theme is not responsive and overriding the CSS is not straightforward.

Took another stab at personalizing [forestry.io](https://forestry.io) instead. That was worth the effort. Itâ€™s pretty nice.

Only things missing:

* Automatic filename generation.
* A native app to add and edit posts.
