I've been working on some issues in open-source repos that I found through [IssueHunt](https://issuehunt.io). It's been going well and the process is quite fun. Collaborating and solving problems together is a welcome change from working on my apps alone. 

The bounty is a nice incentive to tackle some of the bigger issues and ultimate led me to contribute some other changes that I maybe wouldn't have otherwise.

So far I've gotten these merged:
* [Fix scaling in Interface Builder](https://github.com/sindresorhus/CircularProgress/pull/3) in CircularProgress
* [Add cancel feature](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gifski-app/pull/50) in Gifski-app
