I've moved my short posts blog to a custom Jekyll site, hosted on \[Netlify\]([https://www.netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com "https://www.netlify.com")), managed by \[Forestry\]([https://www.forestry.io](https://www.forestry.io "https://www.forestry.io")).

There's nothing I dislike about \[micro.blog\]([https://www.micro.blog](https://www.micro.blog "https://www.micro.blog")), it's just that apparently I _really_ enjoy trying new hosting stuff (Forestry this time).
