Most of my days are spent writing code and designing apps. I make macOS apps like [Denied](https://www.dangercove.com/denied), which protects your ears from bands like Nickelback.

Previously, I co-founded [Hedge](https://hedge.video) and worked on the iOS app at [Blendle](https://blendle.com) &mdash; often described as the Spotify of journalism. Currently I work at Garmin on the Tacx Training app.

Iâ€™m particularly interested in working with new technology and making it accessible to as many people as I can. Tackling technical, UI and UX problems as I go.

Some of my code ends up on [my GitHub page](https://www.github.com/boyvanamstel) or [the one I keep at Danger Cove](https://www.github.com/dangercove).
