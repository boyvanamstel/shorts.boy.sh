Most of my days are spent writing code and designing apps. Primarily for the company that I founded in 2011, called [Danger Cove](http://www.dangercove.com). I make macOS apps like [Denied](https://www.denied.app), which protects your ears from bands like Nickelback.

Previously, I co-founded [Hedge](https://hedge.video) and worked on the iOS app at [Blendle](https://blendle.com) &mdash; often described as the Spotify of journalism.

I’m particularly interested in working with new technology and making it accessible to as many people as I can. Tackling technical, UI and UX problems as I go.

Some of my code ends up on [my GitHub page](https://www.github.com/boyvanamstel) or [the one I keep at Danger Cove](https://www.github.com/dangercove).

I also like to reflect on how people interact with technical innovations, by creating websites like [Please Rob Me](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8521598.stm).

The best way to contact me is through [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/boyvanamstel).
