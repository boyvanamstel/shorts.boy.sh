GitHub entered me into their sponsored developers program! 

This means you can easily [support me](https://github.com/users/boyvanamstel/sponsorship) through [my repos](https://github.com/DangerCove/DCOAboutWindow) or [the projects I contribute to](https://github.com/sindresorhus/Gifski). 👯‍♂️

I made a page where I feature the generous people who sponsor me: [thanks.boy.sh](https://thanks.boy.sh)
