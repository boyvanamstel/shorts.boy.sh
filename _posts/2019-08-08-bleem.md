Sorting through some old stuff I want to sell I came across my original [Bleem!](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-12-11-the-history-of-bleem) disk. I remember it blew my mind when it came out. Playing Playstation games on my computer seemed impossible at the time. Let alone with decent performance.

Convincing my parents to enter their creditcard info on [this shady website](https://web.archive.org/web/20010515082508/http://www.bleem.com/) must have been difficult.

I remember it working fairly well on my computer. It didn't replace my Playstation though.

Here are a few more pictures of the disk.

The manual is amusing.

LGR made a video that's worth a watch if you want to see Bleem! in action.
