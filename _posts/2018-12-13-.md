With [Doom turning 25](https://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/doom-20-years-of-influencing-gaming-1205980), John Romero [announcing a new MEGAWAD called Sigil](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/11/18135751/doom-sigil-the-ultimate-doom-5th-episode-mod-john-romero), while reading Fabian's [DOOM Game Engine Black Book](http://fabiensanglard.net/gebbdoom/) I'm pretty stoked about getting back into DOOM (again).

Sigil inspired me to have another look at making levels for it. I can't even remember the last time I did that. The video below introduces [Slade](http://slade.mancubus.net/), which looks incredible, works on Windows, Macs and Linux. And it's free.
