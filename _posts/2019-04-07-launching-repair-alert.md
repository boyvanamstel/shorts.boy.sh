[Niels](https://www.twitter.com/nielsify) and I released [Repair Alert](https://www.repairalert.me) to the public yesterday. ðŸš€

It's a service that notifies you through email when Apple introduces a new repair or exchange program for one of their products. The only thing you need to do to join, is select the device categories you own and enter your email address.

I dug through my press contacts and emailed a bunch of blogs and news sites before we launched and then again on the actual launch day. MacWelt ended up [writing an article about Repair Alert](https://www.macwelt.de/news/Webdienst-benachrichtigt-ueber-neue-Reparaturprogramme-von-Apple-10537519.html), which eventually driving most of the signups.

Here are the numbers 24 hours after launching:

* 383 subscribers (mostly through MacWelt)
* 68 upvotes on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/repair-alert) (could be better)
* no clue about visitor numbers (I removed analytics all my sites)

MacWelt told us they had about 1.900 views on their article. That means the conversion rate is pretty much off the charts. It actually worries me a little what could happen if more sites decide to do a story. If we cross 2.000 subscribers MailChimp starts to get quite expensive for a project that currently does not have a revenue model. I guess we'll deal with that when it happens.

All in all I'm very happy with how the launch went. People are still steadily subscribing and it's just a matter of time until Apple introduces a new repair or exchange program and we get to see if the system actually works. ðŸ˜…
