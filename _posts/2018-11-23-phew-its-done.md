Phew, it's done. I merged all my apps from their own domain into [dangercove.com](https://www.dangercove.com). The last one on the list was [denied.app](https://www.denied.app). I just got that domain name too, I think it's rather cool.

I'm assuming having my products on one site will boost visitors and hopefully make it a little easier to keep the content up to date. We'll see.
