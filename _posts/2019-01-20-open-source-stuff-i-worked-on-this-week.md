I recently came across [IssueHunt](https://issuehunt.io) and noticed a feature request in [Gifski](https://gif.ski) that I could work on. The PR hasn't been merged yet, so I can't say much about the entire process, but I like the idea of attaching a bounty to issues in open source projects.

* ‚ùå [Add cancel support for Gifski](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gifski-app/pull/50).

I'm considering making an app that allows designers to easily pick and use vibrant/primary/dominant colors from an image. The following projects look like great starting points. I've updated one and added support for macOS to the other.

* üõ† [Update and fix errors in DominantColors](https://github.com/indragiek/DominantColor/pull/44).
* üñ• [Add macOS support to UIImageColors](https://github.com/jathu/UIImageColors/pull/68).
