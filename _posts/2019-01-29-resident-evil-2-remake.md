I finished the first scenario of Resident Evil 2 Remake yesterday, playing as Leon. It was awesome.

It captured the atmosphere of the original perfectly, while improving every aspect you'd expect.

I like how they introduce the time challenge aspect after finishing the game for the first time. I never felt rushed, but it inspired me to go a lot faster for the second play through. Great game.
