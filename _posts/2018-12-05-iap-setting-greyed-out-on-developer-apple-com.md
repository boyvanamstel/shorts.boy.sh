I'm trying to enable In-App Purchases for [Relax](https://www.dangercove.com/relax), so I can implement the Tip Jar featured in the non-Mac App Store version. ðŸ› 

It's not working though. The setting that allows IAPs to be used is greyed out. I've accepted every agreement there is and have had paid apps on the store for a while now. The only reference I can find about it online is [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41676097). Apparently the issue resolved itself after uploading a build.

I've done just that, hoping in two days I can update this post. I'm curious about the underlying cause though. ðŸ¤”

_Update: I turned "Automatically manage signing" off and on again, and voilÃ  the In-App Purchase feature is enabled. Odd._
