_This is an excerpt from a post a published at [posts.boy.sh](https://posts.boy.sh/distracted-by-time)._

Time is a huge distractor for me. Time indicators more specifically. The moment I look at a clock while working, it changes my mood.

_10.00_ – Only 10 am?? It feels like I’ve been doing nothing for ages.
<br>
_11.30_ – Better not start something new because it’ll be lunch time soon.
<br>
_14.00_ - Sheesh this day is never going to end…
<br>
_16.00_ – It’s already 4 pm?? Well, too late to start working now.

### Hide the clock

To remedy this, I stopped wearing my Apple Watch and hid the clock on my Mac and my PC. 

The effects are noticeable; I can just sit, work and not care about how the day is progressing. It's much easier to lose myself in what I’m doing.

There are downsides: it also stops me from getting up and do basic things like drink water or getting some fresh air. I work from home and if I’m not careful I skip lunch and scramble to make something for diner, because I forgot to buy groceries.

### Notifications

I set notifications and reminders for important events that I should not forget. To avoid becoming a slave to my calendar, I came up with a different way to give me a sense of time passing (and make sure I eat properly). It's an app called Timeless.

### Timeless

At its core Timeless gives me a general idea of what part of the day I’m in: morning, lunch time, noon etc. It lets me continue working when I’m still in the time range I’m expecting to get stuff done. Then, in a glance, it lets me know that I’ve entered a new part of the day. If it’s between 12pm and 2pm I should probably get lunch. 

### Beta sign-up

I’m getting ready to let others give this a go as well. If you’d like to be invited to try the beta, [subscribe to the mailing list](https://www.dangercove.com/timeless). Thanks!
