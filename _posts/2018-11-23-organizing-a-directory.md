Organizing a directory full of games into a more convenient set of alphabetized directories (0-9, A-C, D-E etc.) can be quite helpful. I've [written a script](https://gist.github.com/boyvanamstel/50a4365f51325d56fcd597c414ab0e44) that does just that. ðŸ—„

Running `organize_games 25` will create neat collections with an estimated maximum amount of 25 games per directory.
