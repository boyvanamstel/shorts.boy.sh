I changed my workspace at home a few weeks ago. Instead of a dedicated room, I now have a closet to work in. That's right: I fit my entire office inside of a cabinet.

It made me think about all the places where I spend time working on my apps. Currently there are three major workplaces that I alternate between: my closet, a desk at [Blendle](https://www.blendle.com) and random [Croissant affiliated coworking places]()[^croissantaff].

### Working from home

This is my default. I usually wake up and get started straight away at my office-in-a-closet. It's where I feel most comfortable and get done the most. 

### My desk at a previous employer

It's a bit unusual, but I ended up with a dedicated desk at a place I used to work. 

I enjoy the atmosphere, talking to my old colleagues, discussing the product they work on, helping out if I can. It gives me a sense of cohesion and collaboration, even though we work on different projects.

### Coworking

I'm a huge fan of the various coworking spaces that are available in the major cities in the Netherlands. 

Croissant makes it easy to get access to a whole bunch of them without having to pay for each visit. My buddy [Niels](https://www.twitter.com/nielsify) and I usually pick a place in either Amsterdam or Utrecht to work from together. It's pretty great.

### Conclusion

It took me a while to figure out which environment works best for me. Taking into account cost, space required, productivity and social interaction, my current setup is very efficient. 

In the early days of my company I rented dedicated office space. In hindsight this was a luxury; comfortable sure, but overkill and mostly yet another place to store stuff.

I love working from home the most. Some people struggle with distractions, I embrace it. [Building my own apps](https://www.dangercove.com) grants me a lot of freedom around deadlines and office hours. Being able to watch a TV show, play a video game, take a stroll or go bouldering when 'I'm not feeling it' or just to clear my head is crucial to my mental health.
