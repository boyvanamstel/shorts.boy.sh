It's been three years but I might add some posts here again, and on [posts.boy.sh](https://posts.boy.sh).

What's on my mind:
* I have this synth audio setup now that consists of Logic Pro, an [Arturia Minifreak](https://www.arturia.com/products/hardware-synths/minifreak/overview) and too many plugins.
* I have a [Framework Desktop 128GB](https://frame.work/desktop) which is much more fun to tinker on than my MacBook.
* My gaming setup has changed with the Framework Desktop; I stream everything.
