After the macOS Catalina and/or iOS 13 Betas [broke iCloud Drive](https://www.imore.com/developers-encounter-major-icloud-issues-ios-13-beta), I removed the app from my Windows computer. Several duplicated folders and files had appeared that weren't visible on my Mac and mobile devies. Something was definitely wrong and I didn't want to expose my files to it.

Now that Apple seems to have rolled back the changes, I re-installed [iCloud Drive for Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PKTQ5699M62) from the Microsoft Store. I'm surprised to note that it's a completely different app from the one I uninstalled. It's a lot more informative, showing whether files are downloaded or linked in 'the cloud' and it feels more stable overall.

If you've been using iCloud Drive on Windows for a while, it's worth checking if you should switch to the version on the Microsoft Store.
