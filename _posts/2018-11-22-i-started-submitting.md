I started submitting Pull Requests for all the changes I make to the open source projects I use. It's really rewarding.

Before, I'd just resolve issues locally, only submitting a patch when the effort was minimal. Adding support for macOS to Hyper's iOS-only confetti library called Cheers definitely took more time, but the result is pretty great.

* [sindresorhus/LaunchAtLogin](https://github.com/sindresorhus/LaunchAtLogin/pull/17)
* [jekyll/minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/pull/314)
