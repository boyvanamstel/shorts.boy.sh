I've merged tech.boy.sh, code.boy.sh and blog.boyvanamstel.nl all into [posts.boy.sh](https://posts.boy.sh).

The next step in my continuous online content migration plan, or whatever. I first thought splitting the content out would make it easier to write compelling posts for each site. The reality is that the pages just felt empty, making it harder to write at all.

It's weird seeing the first entry is from over ten years ago. I wish I saved the posts I wrote before that.
