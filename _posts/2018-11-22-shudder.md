TIL itâ€™s [Shudder](https://www.shudder.com) (not Shutter) when they talk about the horror streaming service on the ðŸŽ™ [Horror Movie Podcast](https://overcast.fm/itunes589992136/horror-movie-podcast). ðŸ˜…

I'd subscribe in a second, but unfortunately it's not available in The Netherlands. This always happens and a VPN usually works around the issue. Not this time though; Shudder needs a credit card from a supported country.

Oh well, if you are from one of the supported countries, [listen to a HMP episode](https://overcast.fm/+ykWC7p7M) for a coupon that'll let you try Shudder for thirty days instead of seven.
