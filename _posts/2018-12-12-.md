I've been pretty lucky with my recent App Store releases. Usually when I submit my update before midday I could count on Apple's sign of approval the next morning.

The initial Mac App Store release of [Relax](https://www.dangercove.com/relax) is a different story. It's been in review since Friday and I haven't heard a thing after that. The In-App Purchases could be to blame. Apple usually takes extra care reviewing those, [except when they don't](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18123644/ios-app-scam-fitness-tracking-touch-id-trick-payments).

Oh well, fingers crossed it gets approved soon.
